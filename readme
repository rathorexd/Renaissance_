# Synthetic Renaissance Data Generation Using GANs

## Overview
This project aims to generate synthetic Renaissance-style text with realistic printing imperfections (e.g., ink bleed, smudging, faded text) using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The generated data can be used for digital restoration, historical research, and educational tools.

## Features
- **Generator**: A custom U-Net-based architecture for generating degraded text images.
- **Discriminator**: A PatchGAN discriminator for classifying real and synthetic images.
- **Dataset**: Historical Spanish text from the 17th century, rendered with Renaissance-style fonts and augmented with imperfections.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics like SSIM and PSNR are used to evaluate the quality of generated images.
